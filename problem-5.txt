I solved this without programming, only a calculator.

Here are all the primes from 1 to 20:
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19

By multiplying all the primes together, what will our product not be divisible by? Powers of primes less than 20.
These include: 
4 8 16
9

So we should replace 2 with 16, and 3 with 9, and we will cover all divisibilities from 1 to 20 without any extra factors.

Thus our final answer is 16 * 9 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19.
