# Highlights
Problem 6: intuitive solution development, then proved using induction. Turns a O(n) problem into a simple O(1) sequence of arithmetic operations.\
Problem 11: large problem, but used a nice heuristic to speed up computation.\
Problem 12: proved some facts about coprime integers and divisors, and calculated the divisors of a number without knowing the actual value of the number.\
Problem 13: computed the sum of 100 50-digit numbers using multithreading.\
Problem 14: utilized dynamic programming to track the length of Collatz orbits of very large numbers.\
Problem 15: used combinatorics to solve a lattice path problem.
